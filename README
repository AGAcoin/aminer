This is a single-threaded CPU miner for Litecoin and Bitcoin,
fork of Jeff Garzik's reference cpuminer.

License: GPLv2.  See COPYING for details.

Notes for AROS x86 users:
	It supports only one core, thus multi-threading is not possible
	at the moment because of this lack on AROS. Furthermore only
	stratum mining protocol is supported, so longpoll has been
	removed: there is an issue between AROS, its bsdsocket
	library and curl, basically sockets are not shared across
	threads.
	
Notes for AmigaOS 4 and MorphOS users:
	There is already code that support PowerPC platforms, but
	I do not have any next-gen PPC Amiga computer at the moment
	to test AMiner on.

Usage instructions:  see original cpuminer documentation.
